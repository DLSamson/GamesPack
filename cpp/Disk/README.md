# Moving Disk

Well, it is as simple as it can be. 

This code is almost a full copy from this video:     
[Сделал 3D в консоли с нуля | трассировка лучей](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4zUgtDk95w&ab_channel=Onigiri)

It was only the first part, where disk is moving from side to side.

And I also changed output logic. 
It was copied from this article:

It was made from Visual Studio and it works kinda bad in linux terminal, it also has many errors while compiling using g++;

So I recommend compiling it from Visual Studio 22 and use it only on windows cmd console.
